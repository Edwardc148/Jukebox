# Jukebox

Jukebox is a music web application that can adapt to your own personalized style. It is influenced by the Pandora.com with my own twists in design.


## Technology

This full stack application makes use of a variety of software technologies in order to fully implement. Rails, in combination with PostgreSQL, was used for the backend segment of this project.  React and Redux were used in order to maintain the frontend application state.

## Features

- 1. Continuous Music Playback: 


Able to move between same station without retrieving all music again
 Able to change music when changing stations
 Now playing button works
 My stations button does not disrupt music playback
 Play Pause Next Repeat
 Adequate and appropriate seeds to test playback
 Redux/React (appropriate action triggered on button clicks)
